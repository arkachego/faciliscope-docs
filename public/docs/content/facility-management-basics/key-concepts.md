# Key Concepts in Facility Management

Understanding these essential concepts will help you effectively manage facilities and use FaciliScope.

## Maintenance Types

### Preventive Maintenance (PM)

**Definition**: Scheduled, proactive maintenance performed to prevent equipment failures.

**Characteristics**:
- Performed on a regular schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)
- Based on time intervals or usage
- Prevents problems before they occur
- Reduces emergency repairs
- Extends asset lifespan

**Examples**:
- Monthly HVAC filter replacement
- Quarterly equipment inspections
- Annual system servicing
- Regular lubrication of machinery

**Benefits**:
- Lower long-term costs
- Reduced downtime
- Extended asset life
- Better planning and scheduling

### Corrective Maintenance (CM)

**Definition**: Reactive maintenance performed after a failure or problem is identified.

**Characteristics**:
- Performed when something breaks
- Unplanned and often urgent
- Fixes existing problems
- Can be expensive
- Disrupts operations

**Examples**:
- Repairing a broken HVAC unit
- Fixing a leaking pipe
- Replacing failed equipment
- Emergency electrical repairs

**When to Use**:
- Equipment has failed
- Safety issue identified
- Performance degradation
- Unexpected breakdown

### Predictive Maintenance (PdM)

**Definition**: Maintenance based on condition monitoring and data analysis to predict when maintenance is needed.

**Characteristics**:
- Data-driven approach
- Uses sensors and monitoring
- Predicts failures before they occur
- Optimizes maintenance timing
- Reduces unnecessary maintenance

**Examples**:
- Vibration analysis
- Temperature monitoring
- Performance trend analysis
- Condition-based inspections

## Work Order Lifecycle

Work orders progress through several stages:

### 1. Open
- Work order is created
- Needs to be reviewed and assigned
- No work has started

### 2. Assigned
- Work order is assigned to user(s)
- Resources are allocated
- Ready to begin work

### 3. In Progress
- Work has started
- Technicians are actively working
- Time tracking may be active

### 4. On Hold
- Work is temporarily paused
- Waiting for parts, approval, or conditions
- Can be resumed later

### 5. Completed
- Work is finished
- All tasks are done
- Awaiting final review/closure

### 6. Closed
- Work order is finalized
- All documentation complete
- Historical record maintained

## Priority Levels

### Critical
- **Urgency**: Immediate attention required
- **Impact**: Safety risk, major disruption, or significant cost
- **Response Time**: As soon as possible
- **Examples**: Fire safety issues, security breaches, major system failures

### High
- **Urgency**: Needs attention soon
- **Impact**: Affects operations or multiple users
- **Response Time**: Within 24-48 hours
- **Examples**: HVAC failure, plumbing issues, electrical problems

### Medium
- **Urgency**: Normal priority
- **Impact**: Minor disruption or inconvenience
- **Response Time**: Within a week
- **Examples**: Routine repairs, cosmetic fixes, minor maintenance

### Low
- **Urgency**: Can wait
- **Impact**: Minimal or no immediate impact
- **Response Time**: When convenient
- **Examples**: Improvements, upgrades, non-urgent requests

## Asset Lifecycle

Assets go through a complete lifecycle:

### 1. Planning and Procurement
- Identify need
- Research options
- Budget approval
- Purchase decision

### 2. Acquisition and Installation
- Purchase order
- Delivery
- Installation
- Commissioning

### 3. Active Use
- Regular operation
- Preventive maintenance
- Performance monitoring
- Upgrades and modifications

### 4. Maintenance and Repairs
- Scheduled maintenance
- Corrective repairs
- Parts replacement
- System optimization

### 5. End of Life
- Performance degradation
- High maintenance costs
- Obsolete technology
- Replacement planning

### 6. Disposal
- Decommissioning
- Asset removal
- Disposal or sale
- Documentation

## Cost Management

### Types of Costs

**Direct Costs**:
- Labor (technician time)
- Parts and materials
- Contractor services
- Equipment purchases

**Indirect Costs**:
- Overhead allocation
- Administrative costs
- Training and certification
- Software and tools

**Lifecycle Costs**:
- Initial purchase
- Installation
- Operating costs
- Maintenance costs
- Disposal costs

### Budget Management

**Budget Types**:
- **Facility Budget**: For a specific facility
- **Department Budget**: For a department or division
- **Project Budget**: For a specific project
- **Global Budget**: Organization-wide

**Budget Cycle**:
1. Planning - Create budget for period
2. Allocation - Distribute funds to categories
3. Execution - Track spending
4. Monitoring - Compare actual vs. budget
5. Adjustment - Modify as needed

## Compliance and Safety

### Regulatory Compliance

**Types of Compliance**:
- Building codes
- Safety regulations
- Environmental standards
- Industry-specific requirements

**Compliance Management**:
- Track certifications
- Schedule inspections
- Monitor expiration dates
- Maintain documentation

### Safety Management

**Safety Priorities**:
1. **Prevention** - Prevent accidents and incidents
2. **Protection** - Protect people and property
3. **Response** - Respond to emergencies
4. **Recovery** - Restore operations after incidents

## Space Management

### Space Types

- **Office Spaces**: Work areas, cubicles, private offices
- **Common Areas**: Lobbies, hallways, break rooms
- **Specialized Spaces**: Labs, warehouses, parking
- **Outdoor Spaces**: Grounds, parking lots, exterior areas

### Space Utilization

**Metrics**:
- Occupancy rates
- Utilization percentages
- Space efficiency
- Cost per square foot

**Optimization**:
- Right-sizing spaces
- Improving layouts
- Reducing unused space
- Maximizing efficiency

## Energy Management

### Energy Types

- **Electricity**: Power for lighting, equipment, HVAC
- **Water**: Consumption and wastewater
- **Gas**: Heating and cooking
- **Steam**: Industrial processes
- **Renewable**: Solar, wind, etc.

### Energy Efficiency

**Strategies**:
- Monitor consumption
- Identify waste
- Optimize systems
- Upgrade equipment
- Behavioral changes

## Documentation and Records

### Important Documents

- **Asset Records**: Specifications, manuals, warranties
- **Maintenance History**: All work performed
- **Compliance Certificates**: Inspections, certifications
- **Financial Records**: Budgets, invoices, costs
- **Safety Records**: Incidents, inspections, training

### Document Management

- **Organization**: Categorize and tag documents
- **Storage**: Centralized, accessible location
- **Version Control**: Track document versions
- **Retention**: Maintain records per requirements
